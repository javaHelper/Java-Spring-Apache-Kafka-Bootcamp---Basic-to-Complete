 * A wrapper of ESLint linter

 * which includes:
 *
 * - defining the rules that should be used during linting,
 * - declaring globals that need to be considered as such
 * - defining the environments bringing a set of predefined variables
 *
 * Because some rules target main files while other target test files (or even
 * both), the wrapper relies on two linting configurations to decide which set
 * of rules should be considered during linting.
 *
 * Last but not least, the linter wrapper eventually turns ESLint problems,
